        <h2>How you use it:</h2>
        <p>
          It's really quite easy.  You're already at nebree8.com and you can
          order from here.  You'll have to decide whether you want a cocktail
          from our cocktail list or whether you trust <b>science</b> to make you
          a drink, then put in your name and select the 'Make Drink' option, let
          one of us know you've ordered, and we'll take it from there.  Check
          back on your device to see how many people have ordered in front of
          you and how far along your drink is.
        </p>

        <h2>How it works, in layman's terms:</h2>
        <p>
          N.E.Bree-8 effectively starts where we've overmounted a hypo-tranical 
          boro-amulated rail with an ortho-tragonal Smith-style slide lucket.
          We've also added a tangolium oxide resonister to the lucket by
          affixing it directly to a hyper-mothric belt.  We've positioned the
          whole assembly such that an amortho-ripple stream of Bryant-Aikman
          hydro-ethanicolloid liquid can be poured into the unicrallated
          receptacle. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Key to preventing uncontrolled oversloshing is the inclusion of a high
          precision load splafter.  To get bit-rich flacterated data into our
          Staubach cortex, we've implemented our 'brain'.  It is a
          modulo-plastic tri-core architecture bicompiled with a Flubento Humix 
          operating system. Onto it we've loaded an overstructured
          Landry-nomenclature database running Ludon v2.7. This serves to
          scriptologically packet-yank the cloud stream monodata from the
          user/web interaction. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Simply put, this allows us to make the best possible cocktail.
        </p>

        <h2>How it works, for the highly technical:</h2>
        <p>
          N.E.Bree-8 is a sealed cabinet with up to 31 ingredients.  Each
          ingredient is placed inside in a bottle with its top open and a straw
          into the liquid.  Each straw has an electronic valve which is
          controlled by our central computer.  When we pressurize the cabinet,
          we can open an individual valve and the interior pressure forces the
          liquid from the bottle out through the straw.
        </p>

        <p>
          The cup with your drink is set on a vacuum chuck, which holds the cup 
          in place by pulling a vacuum on the bottom of the cup.  Then, the
          vacuum chuck can be moved along a rail system so that the cup is
          beneath the specific valve outlet that the computer is opening.  As
          your cocktail ingredient is poured, the robot weighs the cup so that
          it knows just how much to include.
        </p>

        <p>
          The computer is hooked up to the internet so that we can read your
          orders and receive your feedback.  The rest is magic!
        </p>

        <h2>Who we are and how we built it:</h2>
        <p>
          There are 5 engineers who have worked together to bring you
          N.E.Bree-8:
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sam Horn (chemical engineer)</li>
          <li>Travis 'T-$' Briggs (full-stack developer)</li>
          <li>Sagar Mittal (electrical engineer and full-stack developer)</li>
          <li>Mark Stevens (electrical engineer and full-stack developer)</li>
          <li>Will Fischer (mechanical engineer)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The team started in response to the
          <a href="https://www.dnalounge.com/tickets/robots/">DNA Lounge's Cocktail Robotics Grand Challenge</a>.
          Mark and Will attended high school together and became friends
          in the robotics club.  They were unable to turn down another
          opportunity to compete&mdash;this time with liquor&mdash;and recruited
          their friends to aid in the engineering.  The Cocktail Robotics Grand
          Challenge is a competition in which we have participated for three
          years, winning Honorable Mention in 2014, and placing first in 2015
          and again in 2016.

        </p>

        <h2>Can I have one of my own?</h2>
        <p>
          Sure, I guess.  I mean, it's complex as hell to build one for
          yourself, but you should try anyway.  If you want us to build one for
          you, well, I guess maybe you're rich.  Sure, let's chat.  ;)
